# Best-Of-Youtube

Best-Of-Youtube is a web application built using React, Bootstrap, Node.js, and Express.js. The app leverages the YouTube Data API to fetch and display the top videos based on user search queries. The videos are arranged in order of views and likes, providing users with the best content available on YouTube for their search term.


## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with React and Bootstrap, the app offers a clean and responsive UI that adapts to various devices.
- **Top Video Retrieval:** Utilizes the YouTube Data API to fetch videos related to the user's search query.
- **Sorting by Popularity:** Videos are automatically sorted by the number of views and likes, ensuring that users get the most relevant and popular content.


# Usage
Once the application is running, you can enter any search query in the search bar. The app will then fetch and display the top videos related to that query, sorted by views and likes.



# Scenarios Where This Project Can Be Useful
- You can get only the videos related to your search query. The YouTube recommendation algorithm will not affect the videos list here.
- You can avoid non-academic content if you search for academic content only. The app will only show videos that correspond to your search query.
